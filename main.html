                    <section class="life">Hello! I am a person who loves adventure and trying new foods. I have a Shih Tzu named Smokey. Since I was a child, Scooby-Doo has always been my favorite cartoon. I am a huge fan of Walt Disney World, so much so that I have worked there in the past. I love to read and any adventure involving water, I will be there. I have done the Tough Mudder 4 times and look forward to doing it many more times in the future. My previous career was in Mental Health, specifically with Addictions and Substance Abuse. I am a hardcore introvert and prefer being in nature than dealing with people.</section>

                    <section class="life">I have always been interested in Software Engineering and recently started my certification in Blockchain. I enjoy helping people and substance abuse and addictions but at this point, I would like to do more work behind the scenes than deal with people. I enjoy the challenge and technical aspecs of software engineering. I did around 6 months of research to look for another career that matched where I am in life right now. Since I have always been interested and it matched all of my new career requirments, I decided to pull the trigger and start my new career. I would like to eventually work for an international company and focus more on Blockchain. Until then, staying in the Mental Health arena as a Software Engineer is what I would like to do.</section>
